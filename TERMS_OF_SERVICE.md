Last updated: October 2, 2025

## 1) Acceptance of Terms
By downloading, installing, or using Hater AI (the “App”), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service (“Terms”). If you do not agree, do not use the App.

## 2) What Hater AI Does (Entertainment Only)
Hater AI is an entertainment application that generates humorous, roast-style responses using AI. The content is fictional, automated, and intended for fun only. Do not rely on it for advice of any kind.

## 3) Subscriptions, In‑App Purchases, and Billing
- The App offers auto‑renewable subscriptions and optional one‑time purchases. Prices and durations are shown in‑app prior to purchase.
- Payment is charged to your Apple ID account. Subscriptions renew automatically unless canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. You can manage or cancel subscriptions in your iOS device Settings → Apple ID → Subscriptions. Restoring purchases is available in‑app.
- Refunds are handled by Apple. To request a refund, visit Apple’s Report a Problem: https://reportaproblem.apple.com/
- If the App offers free trials or promos, any unused portion is forfeited when you purchase a subscription (where applicable).

## 4) Bring Your Own Key (BYOK) — Third‑Party AI Providers
- The App can connect to third‑party AI services (e.g., OpenAI, Cohere, Google Gemini) if you choose to provide your own API key. Use of any third‑party service is governed by that provider’s own terms and privacy policies.
- You are responsible for any costs incurred with third‑party providers, including usage fees and rate limits. We do not control third‑party availability, quality, or billing.

## 5) Features Not Present
- No speech‑to‑text recording, no real‑time audio input.
- No video generation or TikTok video export.
- No third‑party advertising SDKs; no cross‑app tracking.

## 6) Acceptable Use and User Conduct
- Use the App only for lawful purposes and personal entertainment.
- Do not attempt to harass, bully, defame, or target protected classes or individuals.
- Do not upload illegal content or attempt to abuse, disrupt, reverse engineer, or interfere with the App or its services.

## 7) Content Disclaimer
- AI outputs may be incorrect, offensive, or inappropriate. You understand and agree that all AI content is provided “as‑is” and for entertainment only. We do not endorse AI outputs and are not liable for how you use them.

## 8) Safety and Sensitive Situations
If you encounter content related to self‑harm, danger, or emergencies, seek immediate help from appropriate local resources or emergency services. The App is not a substitute for professional help.

## 9) Age Requirement
You must be at least 13 years old (or older if required by your local law) to use the App. If you are under the age of majority, you must have your parent or legal guardian’s consent.

## 10) Analytics and Privacy
- We collect limited, non‑tracking analytics to improve the App (e.g., feature usage, performance). We do not use IDFA, cross‑app tracking, or third‑party ad networks.
- See our full Privacy Policy for details: https://martyhines.github.io/hater-ai-realtime-server/PRIVACY_POLICY.md

## 11) Termination
We may suspend or terminate access to the App at any time for violations of these Terms or where required by law. You may stop using the App at any time. Uninstalling the App does not automatically cancel subscriptions—you must manage them in iOS Settings.

## 12) Disclaimers; Limitation of Liability
- THE APP AND ALL CONTENT ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE,” WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.
- TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, PROFITS, OR REVENUE, ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF THE APP OR AI OUTPUTS.

## 13) Changes to These Terms
We may update these Terms from time to time. Material changes will be reflected by updating the “Last updated” date above. Continued use of the App after changes take effect constitutes acceptance.
