- Any mismatch will cause purchases to fail
- Double-check all product IDs before submitting

- Your code only references the product IDs
- Prices can be updated in the stores without code changes

### Testing
- Always test IAPs thoroughly before release
- Test both successful and failed purchase scenarios
- Test on both iOS and Android devices

### App Review
- Apple and Google will test your IAPs during review
- Make sure all products work correctly
- Provide clear descriptions of what users get
